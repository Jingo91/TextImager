# TextImager
A UIMA-based System for Processing Documents and Visualizing the Data.

TextImager is a web application for performing automatic text analyses on various levels of linguistic resolutions. It offers a range of NLP and visualization tools by means of a user-friendly GUI. The backend is based on the Unstructured Information Management Applications (UIMA) framework. Currently, the scope of TextImager ranges from tokenizing, lemmatizing, POS-tagging, text similarity measurements to sentiment analysis, text classification, topic modeling and many more. 
The frontend of TextImager is based on ExtJS while the visualizations are made with frameworks like d3.js, viz.js and many more.
